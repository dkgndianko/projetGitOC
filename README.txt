In this file I'll explain how I created that project.
First I created a directory in my local machine in which I run the command "git init".
After that I created a repository to my Github account.
After my commit in my local machine I made a "git remote add origin" commit with the URL I got from githubi.
Then I use the command git push -u origin master to send the content of my local repository to the remote.
